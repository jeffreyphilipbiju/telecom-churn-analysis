# 📊 Telecom Customer Churn Analysis

## 📌 Overview
Customer churn is a critical issue for telecom companies, as retaining customers is far more cost-effective than acquiring new ones.  
This project analyzes data from **7,032 customers with 21 features** to uncover churn patterns, build predictive models, and generate actionable business insights.  
An **interactive Power BI dashboard** was also developed for easy exploration of churn trends.

## 🔍 What I Did
- **Data Cleaning & Preprocessing**  
  - Handled missing values, performed categorical encoding, and standardized features.

- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**  
  - Analyzed customer demographics, contract types, payment methods, and service usage.  
  - Visualized churn distribution → **26% churned vs 74% retained**.

- **Predictive Modeling**  
  - Built and evaluated machine learning models:  
    - Logistic Regression → **AUC: 0.8457**  
    - Random Forest → **AUC: 0.8217**

- **Dashboard Development**  
  - Designed an interactive **Power BI dashboard** showing churn by demographics, services, and contracts.

## 📈 Key Insights
- Customers with **month-to-month contracts** are more likely to churn.  
- **Electronic check** payment users show the highest churn rate.  
- Customers with **tenure < 12 months** have a strong churn tendency.  
- Higher **monthly charges** increase churn probability.  

**Business Recommendations:**  
✔ Introduce loyalty programs to increase customer tenure  
✔ Offer incentives for switching to long-term contracts  
✔ Improve digital payment experiences to reduce drop-offs
